    <p>In Umbra’s beta phase, we are working with a test collection—a sample of records from 25 content sources that represents the kinds of materials you will find in Umbra. We will be adding materials and partners throughout 2015. Umbra is scheduled to officially launch early 2016.</p>

    <h4>What is Umbra?</h4>

    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>The "<em>umbra</em>" is a complete or perfect shadow cast by the moon, a spectral vision, or the  central region of a sunspot.</li>

      <li><em>Umbra: Search African American History</em> is a freely available discovery tool, created for use by the public for the research and study of African American history and culture. It assembles a national collection of digital materials--images, videos, books, and more--for use by scholars, artists, parents, students, and educators. Materials displayed in <em>Umbra</em> are provided by libraries, museums, and other <a href="/catalog/facet/dataProvider_s?facet.sort=index&limit=100&q=&search_field=all_fields&facet_view=full">repositories around the country</a>.</li>

      <li><em>Umbra: Search African American History</em> seeks to inspire and activate new ideas, forms of scholarship and education, community projects, and works of art by creating access to the materials that document more than 500 years of African American history and cultural.</li>

      <li><em>Umbra: Search African American History</em> is a partnership between the University of Minnesota Libraries and Penumbra Theatre Company.</li>
